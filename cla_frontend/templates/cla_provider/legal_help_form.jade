            strong Purpose 
            br
        p This privacy notice sets out the standards that you can expect from the Legal Aid Agency when we request or hold personal information (‘personal data’) about you; how you can get access to a copy of your personal data; and what you can do if you think the standards are not being met.
        p The Legal Aid Agency is an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The MoJ is the data controller for the personal information we hold. The Legal Aid Agency collects and processes personal data for the exercise of its own and associated public functions. Our public function is to provide legal aid.

          li In conducting periodic assurance audits on legal aid files to ensure that decisions have been made correctly and accurately.
          li In producing statistics and information on our processes to enable us to improve our processes and to assist us in carrying out our functions.
        p Were the Legal Aid Agency unable to collect this personal information, we would not be able to conduct the activities above, which would prevent us from providing legal aid.
        p The lawful basis for the Legal Aid Agency collecting and processing your personal data is in the administration of justice and the result of the powers contained in Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.
        p We also collect ‘special categories of personal data’ for the purposes of monitoring equality, this is a legal requirement for public authorities under the Equality Act 2010.

          li By "partner" we mean anyone (including a person of the same sex) that you live with as a couple. Your partner "lives with" you even if they are not living in the same house as you (e.g. because you or your partner works away from home) unless one of you considers that your relationship is over. You should not give details of your partner's money if the problem you are seeking advice about is a dispute with your partner.
          li You need to tell us if you get Income Support, Income-Based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income-related employment and support allowance or Guaranteed State Pension Credit (under section 1(3)(a) of the State Pension Credit Act (a)) in ‘Your Finances’ but you do not need to fill in sections ‘Your Capital’ and ‘Your Income’ of the form. If your partner gets the benefit and you are included in your partner's benefit claim, you count as someone who gets the benefit "indirectly".
          li The equity in your home is the amount left over after the mortgage you owe has been paid in full. The first £100,000 equity is not counted. We work out equity as follows. Take the market value of your property and take away the mortgage you still have to pay. If the result is £0 we assess the property as having no equity (£0). This will appear in the box called ‘Equity in the home for assessment purposes’. If £1 or more is left we subtract £100,000, which allows you some equity in your property. We use the figure that is left for our assessment. Where this £0 or less we count it as £0. Here is an example:
            .indent

                li Any payment made out of the social fund;
                li Carer’s Allowance; and
                li Council Tax benefit.
              li Any direct payments made under regulations made under the Health and Social Care Act 2001 (direct payments), section 17A of the Children Act 1989 (direct payments) or the Carers and Direct Payments Act (Northern Ireland) 2002;
              li Severe Disablement Allowance paid under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (or the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992);
              li Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance paid under the Personal Injuries (Civilians) (Amendment) Scheme 1983;
              li Any pensions paid under the Naval, Military, Air Forces etc (Disability & Death) Service Pensions Order 2006(c);
              li To the extent that it exceeds the relevant dependants allowance made under reg.25(2)(b), any financial support paid under any agreement for the care of a foster child; and
              li Any payment made out of the Independent Living Fund (2006); and
              li Any personal independence payment paid under the Welfare Reform Act 2012.
          li If your gross income is more than £2,657 per month you will not normally get funding for Legal Aid but if you have more than 4 dependent children this figure goes up by £222 per extra child. E.g. if you have six children your gross income can be as much as £3,101 (£2,657+£222+£222) and you still might qualify.
          li If you receive Housing Benefit only the amount that you pay yourself should be put in the ‘Rent’ box. If you have no dependents, the maximum allowance for housing costs is £545.
          li Dependent relatives are: children under 15, or children between 16 and 19 still at school, who live in the same house as you and who rely on you to support them. There is a standard allowance of £296.65 for each dependent relative who lives with you. If you currently have a partner that lives with you then you will receive an allowance of £184.46 for this partner.
          li There is a standard allowance of £45 if you or your partner is working. If you both work, you both get the allowance.
          li You should put in the box how much you spent on childcare because you have to go to work.
          li Your disposable income is what is left when your (and any partner’s) total monthly allowances are taken away from your (and any partner’s) total gross monthly income.

          p Note: When calculating profit costs, the time spent on each activity and the letters and telephone calls must be separated out according to the remuneration rate which applied at the time the work was carried out. Please see the Payment Annex of the 2010 Standard Civil Contract for the appropriate rates.
          p Remember that you may not charge separately for letters in.
          p The totals for profit costs, disbursements and counsel's fees from this form and the Controlled Legal Representation Form (if applicable) should be the same (after adding VAT and net of the amount of the statutory charge and any payment on account), as those reported by you in your online submission. Where a staged bill has been submitted in an Immigration matter a separate copy of this page should be completed for each stage reported.
