Local authorities have a statutory obligation to provide accommodation and assistance to anyone who is homeless or threatened with homelessness (ie will become homeless within 28 days).

To be in scope, the client will currently be homeless or have been threatened with losing their home within 28 days and need to get accommodation and/or help from the local housing authority.

Alternatively, they may wish to challenge a letter they've received from the local authority, which says that they are not eligible for accommodation and assistance.

A client will be considered to be homeless if they:

* have no accommodation physically available to occupy in the UK or elsewhere, or
* have no accommodation available which they are legally entitled to live in, or
* have accommodation that is available and that they are entitled to live in but can't gain entry into it, or
* have accommodation available that they are entitled to occupy, but that accommodation is a moveable structure and there is no place where they are entitled or permitted both to place and live in it, or
* have accommodation available, which they are entitled to live in but it is not reasonable to continue to do so
