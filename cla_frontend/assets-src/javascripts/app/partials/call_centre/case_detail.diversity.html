    <p>From the information you have provided, the assessment shows that you may be eligible for Legal Aid and I will transfer you to one of our Specialist Providers.</p>
    <p>We cannot guarantee that the specialist will be able to take on your case, however their service is not your only option and the specialist will try to find you some help elsewhere. If they do take on your case you will need to provide proof of your financial circumstances for the specialist to continue.</p>
    <p>Before I transfer you, I just need to ask you some equality and diversity questions. You do not need to answer any of these questions but your cooperation in providing us with accurate data will ensure that we not only meet our legal obligations, but even more importantly will result in you receiving fair and just treatment in your interactions with us.
