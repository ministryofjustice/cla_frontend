# Lint Workflow Documentation
#  GitHub Actions workflow for running linting checks on the cla_frontend repository.
#
#  Purpose:
#    - Executes automated code quality and style checks on pull requests
#    - Runs Python linting using flake8 to maintain code standards
#
#  Triggers:
#    - Activates on all pull requests across any branch
#
#  Jobs:
#    - setup: Initializes workflow environment variables and outputs them for dependent jobs
#    - python: Executes Python-based linting checks using flake8 in a Python 2.7.18 container
#
#  Key Features:
#    - Minimal permissions set (contents: read only for Python job)
#    - Uses environment variables for timezone and environment configuration
#    - Runs flake8 with exit-zero flag to report violations without failing the workflow
#    - Depends on setup job for environment output propagation
#
#  Requirements:
#    - Python linting dependencies installed from requirements/generated/requirements-lint.txt
